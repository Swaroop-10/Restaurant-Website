### General Info:
**********************************************************************************************************************************************************
This Website page showcases the Restaurant website. In this project, I have used HTML - CSS - JS. I have developed it mostly using HTML and CSS. 
The main idea behind developing this was to partially reduce the HTML code using JavaScript. This will help in understanding the development of website in HTML and 
how JavaScript will make it more useful.

### Technologies:
**********************************************************************************************************************************************************
For making this website I used following Technologies(Languages)
1. HTML 5
2. CSS 3
3. JavaScript

### Use:
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************
A restaurant website is old-fashioned and now Zomato, Swiggy are capturing market. But few Hotels like it the old-way. So here it's very basic website to select 
food category, go through gallery, dive into Speciality, Sign up for booking table. 
This website serves a base for many applications in future like: Order online, payment gateway, Food menu.

Thank you!
